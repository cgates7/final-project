    "text": "Why Does This Matter?\nBased on the dataset of 50 outfielders, the 2024 roster displays a sprint speed range from 24.8 ft/s (Giancarlo Stanton) to 30.5 ft/s (Bobby Witt Jr.), with the league average hovering around 27.0 ft/s. While a difference of just 3-4 feet per second may seem negligible on paper, it translates to a massive difference in defensive range over the course of a fly ball’s hang time. An elite runner like Witt Jr. or Trea Turner can cover approximately 15 to 20 more feet of ground than a power hitter like Stanton or Schwarber during a typical 4-5 second fly ball play. This extra coverage expands their effective “catch radius” exponentially—meaning an elite defender doesn’t just catch balls hit further away, they can effectively patrol a circular area nearly 30-40% larger than their slower counterparts, turning potential gap doubles into routine outs."

    "text": "Purpose of This Model\nThe purpose of this model is to visualize and analyze the catch probability of fly balls across every Major League Baseball stadium for the entire 2024 season. By aggregating Statcast data and mapping it onto custom stadium geometries, the tool allows users to see exactly where balls land relative to specific park dimensions—accounting for factors like exit velocity, launch angle, and spray angle. It employs a logistic regression algorithm to estimate the likelihood of a catch (displayed as a color gradient from green to red) and includes logic to “snap” errant data points back into the field of play, ensuring that balls recorded as hits stay within the fences while home runs clear them.\nUltimately, this interactive visualization helps identify how different stadium layouts impact defensive performance and offensive outcomes."
